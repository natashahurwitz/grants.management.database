# grants.management.database

This project was created by Natasha Hurwitz.  It is the basic work of demonstrating skills in MySQL using Workbench.

The federal government has several agencies that issue research grants.  This database design project focuses on federal research grants issued to institutions supporting military nurse researchers.  

List of files and what they are:
grantee_organization - Excel file with list of grant numbers, organizations and fiscal years (this was used to double check that things were working properly and is not a necessary file to the project.)
hurwitz_grants_db_backup - backup of the database
hurwitz_grants_db_ERD_post - Entity Relationship Diagram, post - shows how tables are joined and where information is stored.
hurwitz_grants_db_ERD_pre - Entity Relationship Diagram, pre - shows how tables are joined and where information is stored.
hurwitz_grants_db_queries.txt - Explains each query, gives the code for each query and explains which project requirements were met by the query.
hurwitz_grants_db_report.doc - Explanation of the project.
